Packages and Modules
====================

Module
------
what is a module?

its called as library in other tech

in Python a normal python program and a module will have the same extension
 .py

any python program can be considered as a module


Location where the modules can be placed

import mymodule
---------------
1. look for .pth file in the python native path, if the file is found then import all the paths from the file into the variable sys.path

2. if a module is present in a specified path then import the module

3. Before importing the module convert the module into .pyc file and dump it into __pychache__ folder

4. if we are importing the file for the second time then python compares the date and time of creation of .py and .pyc files. python expects .pyc file to have the latest date and time

3. if the .py file has the latest date or time copared to the .pyc file then python considers that there was an update in the code and recompiles the .py file to create a new .pyc file with the updates


import mymodule

from mymodule import class

from mymodule import function

import mypackage.mymodule

from mypackage import *		
------------------------

packages - classes

class - instantiate a class -> __init__ method

package - try to access a file then -> executes __init__.py
