we have different modes of opening

1. read 	- default mode of opening a file, if open the file in read mode then we 
		  only read the file.

2. write	- if the file is already existing then it will delete the contents of the 		  file and then write into the file. if the file is not existing then 			  create the file and add the contents into the file. 

3. append	- if the file is already existing then it adds the content into the same 		  file without disturbing the old contents. if the file is not existing 		  then create the file and add the contents into the file. 

randomly open the file and read the contents
